            <dt>What is a yurt?</dt>
            <dd>
                Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls,
                a wooden floor, a roof dome that can be opened, and a private deck.
            </dd>

            <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
            <dd>
                Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down quilt, comfy couch,
                dining table and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience
                includes a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.
            </dd>

            <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
            <dd>
                Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers
                of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
