                <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
                <p>
                    Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls,
                    a wooden floor, a roof dome that can be opened, and a private deck.

                <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
                <p>
                    Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down quilt, comfy couch,
                    dining table and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience
                    includes a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

                <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
                <p>
                    Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers
                    of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
